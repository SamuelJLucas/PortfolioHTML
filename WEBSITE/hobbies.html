        <summary>Why I Like Books</summary>
    <p>Books are these wonderful, wonderful things to me. In a few ways. In one they are a tool for self growth<br/>
        because we can reach into others' understandings through them. We don't have to build everything from the <br/>
        beginning. It is insanely interesting to see people's points of view laid down on the page when, while <br/>
        speaking it is so easy for meanings to fall away. Books are edited, read over, proofread, reviewed, and <br/>
        the author can put as much work as they want into getting their idea across before you even see a single <br/>
        piece of it. Their feelings, dreams, discoveries, there is so much to see.

    </p>
    <p>It is very similar when reading novels. My favorite is the cozy genre. You can see the same amount of <br/>
    who people are put into novels, but in the cozy genre it is the lightest and most loving areas of the person<br/>
    that take center stage. Novels in this subgenre tend to cover heartwarming human actions and desires. It isn't<br/>
    that there aren't tensions, twisted scenarios, or horrible things that happen. Rather, these things are all <br/>
    there. The authors simply follow the flawed people that grow to be better.</p>
